		<p>Welcome to my little template.  This was created using <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> as the backend framework, and <a href="http://www.semantic-ui.com">Semantic UI</a> for the front end.  It is an evolving project currently just called CI Template.</p>
<p>To get started, you need to login.  The default login is username: dev password: dev.  From there you can create new users and stuff, and at some point create new tables and stuff as well.</p>
